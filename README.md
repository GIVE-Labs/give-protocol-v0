# MorphImpact

A DeFi platform that lets you support NGOs by staking crypto instead of donating. You keep your principal, they get the yield.

## The Problem

Traditional NGO donations have issues:
- 30-50% goes to intermediaries
- You lose your money forever
- No transparency in fund usage
- Zero engagement after donating

## How It Works

Instead of giving money away, you stake ETH/USDC on Morph Chain. The yield goes to your chosen NGO, and you get your principal back after the lock period.

**Example:**
- Stake 1 ETH for a verified education NGO
- Choose 75% yield contribution (keep 25%)
- 12-month lock period
- NGO gets ~0.075 ETH in yield, you get 1 ETH back + 0.025 ETH
